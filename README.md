# suc-attendance
This is a fullstack project to help Suffolk University's clubs with attendance!

## ‼️ Importance of tracking attendance
Clubs often need to know their membership statistics in order to keep track of the success of events, giveaways, and more. This project 
simplifies the hassle of each member needing to sign in with a sheet or shared laptop to a quick QR code scan with a one time sign up. After that, all users need to do is hit one button to ✨automagically✨ sign in.

Some uses cases may include:
 - giving rewards after member attends N meetings
 - track popularity of events/workshops
 - measuring club growth with collected stats
 
## 🧐 Detailed overview
When a user visits the page for the first time, they are prompted to sign up with their name and suffolk id. After this single sign up, members
will be remembered for their next visit, which means next time they sign in to the club, they won't be prompted to enter their credentials again.

This shines especially on repeat sign-ins, when a QR code + 1 click is all that's needed 🚀

After they choose a club, their entry is recorded to an E-Board facing Google Spreadsheet.

## 🤑 Pricing
$10/semester baseline. Scales up with club size; negotiable.

### 💻 Tech stuff
Frontend written in React.js, backend in express on Google Cloud Functions. This section will be expanded later 😉
